/*
    
    ## A friend function
        - in C++ is a function that is not a member of a class but is allowed to access the classâ€™s private and protected members. 
        
        - You declare a friend function inside the class using the friend keyword.

    ## Key points:

        - It is defined outside the class, but has access to its private/protected data.
        - It is useful when you want to allow a non-member function to access private data of a class.
