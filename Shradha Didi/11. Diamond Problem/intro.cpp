/*
    ## Diamond Problem :
        - The Diamond Problem occurs in C++ with multiple inheritance when a class inherits from two classes that both inherit from a common base class.
        
        - This can cause ambiguity about which base class members are inherited.

    ## Key Points:
        - Happens in multiple inheritance.
        - Both parent classes inherit from the same grandparent class.
        - The child class inherits from both parents, causing two copies of the grandparentâ€™s members.
        - Leads to ambiguity and redundancy.

    ## How It Solved :
        - The diamond problem is solved using virtual inheritance in C++.
        - This ensures only one instance of the grandparent class is present in the inheritance hierarchy.
